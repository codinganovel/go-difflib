go-difflib
==========

THIS PACKAGE IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED BY THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR.

At this point, I have no longer the time nor the interest to work on go-difflib. I apologize for the inconvenience.

**UPDATE**: This fork is now minimally maintained as I've started using it in a personal project. Basic functionality and Go compatibility will be preserved.

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/codinganovel/go-difflib/difflib?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/codinganovel/go-difflib/difflib)

Go-difflib is a partial port of python 3 difflib package. Its main goal
was to make unified and context diff available in pure Go, mostly for
testing purposes.

The following class and functions (and related tests) have be ported:

* `SequenceMatcher`
* `unified_diff()`
* `context_diff()`
* `get_close_matches()` (as `GetCloseMatches`)
* `ndiff()` + `restore()` (as `NDiff` and `Restore`) â€” basic version
* `Differ` (with simple intraline "? " hints)

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/codinganovel/go-difflib/difflib
```

### More Examples

Close matches (fuzzy suggestions):

```go
matches := difflib.GetCloseMatches(
    "appel",
    []string{"ape", "apple", "peach", "puppy"},
    3, 0.6,
)
// matches => []string{"apple", "ape"}
```

Basic ndiff + restore (human-friendly line deltas):

```go
a := difflib.SplitLines("one\ntwo\nthree\n")
b := difflib.SplitLines("zero\none\nthree\n")
delta := difflib.NDiff(a, b)

// Reconstruct originals from the delta
a2 := difflib.Restore(delta, 1) // == a
b2 := difflib.Restore(delta, 2) // == b
```

Intraline hints with Differ (shows character-level changes using "? "):

```go
d := &difflib.Differ{}
delta := d.Compare(
    difflib.SplitLines("abc\n"),
    difflib.SplitLines("axc\n"),
)
// Emits lines prefixed with:
//   "  " (equal), "- " (delete), "+ " (insert), "? " (intraline guide)
```

### Notes

- `NDiff` currently emits only line-level changes; intraline "? " guide lines are available via `Differ`.
- `LineJunk`/`CharJunk` filters are scaffolded on `Differ` but not yet active.
- `diff_bytes` and `HtmlDiff` are not yet implemented; see `TO-DO.md` for parity tasks.

## API

`NDiff`

```go
func NDiff(a, b []string) []string
```

- Emits ndiff-style lines with prefixes: `"  "` (equal), `"- "` (delete), `"+ "` (insert).
- Does not include intraline `"? "` guide lines; use `Differ` for those.
- Inputs should be `SplitLines(...)` output to preserve end-of-line markers.
- Output is suitable for `Restore` to reconstruct either original sequence.

`Restore`

```go
func Restore(delta []string, which int) []string
```

- Reconstructs sequence 1 (`which == 1`) or sequence 2 (`which == 2`) from an ndiff delta.
- Ignores lines prefixed with `"? "` if present.
- Returns `nil` for invalid `which` values.

`Differ`

```go
type Differ struct {
    LineJunk func(string) bool   // currently not applied
    CharJunk func(rune) bool     // currently not applied
}

func (d *Differ) Compare(a, b []string) []string
```

- Produces ndiff-style output, including intraline `"? "` hints for replacements.
- Intraline markers: `^` for replacements, `-` under deletions (aline), `+` under insertions (bline).
- Trailing spaces may appear in `"? "` lines to align markers with characters; examples trim them for readability.
- Current implementation pairs replaced lines greedily; advanced "fancy replace" heuristics are TBD.

### Quick Start

Diffs are configured with Unified (or ContextDiff) structures, and can
be output to an io.Writer or returned as a string.

```Go
diff := difflib.UnifiedDiff{
    A:        difflib.SplitLines("foo\nbar\n"),
    B:        difflib.SplitLines("foo\nbaz\n"),
    FromFile: "Original",
    ToFile:   "Current",
    Context:  3,
}
text, _ := difflib.GetUnifiedDiffString(diff)
fmt.Printf(text)
```

would output:

```
--- Original
+++ Current
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
 foo
-bar
+baz
```
